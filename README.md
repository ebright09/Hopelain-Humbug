1. **Value Creation** - The Wedge between survival and domination
2. **Brand Audits** - Architecture for the architecturally gifted
3. **Brand Soul** - Liquid Death & the art of selling water to goths
4. **Positioning** - Climbing the ladder without falling off
5. **Influencers** - Trust transfer & the leasing of souls
6. **Content Strategy** - Away's playbook for category domination
7. **Performance** - Funnels, metrics & the art of conversion
8. **Loyalty** - Byron Sharp vs. everyone else
9. **Brand Moats** - Building fortresses for fun and profit

## 🎭 The Tone

> *"Prove you aren't just an expensive PowerPoint generator."*

The game maintains an elite, slightly arrogant, intellectually sharp tone—with the wit of a suave coastal elite and the strategic rigor of a Haas MBA. Expect:
- Marketing jargon deployed with surgical precision
- Backhanded compliments for success
- Devastating roasts for failure
- References to McKinsey, Byron Sharp, and the Value Wedge
